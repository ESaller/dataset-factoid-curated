Utilities for updating the dataset using Mechanical Turk:

  * Generate "qdata" json files with mturk/yodaqa-get.py
    (they contain answers generated by YodaQA, including passages etc.)

  * Put up the mturk/mtpage.html on Mechanical Turk.

  * Generate the Mechanical Turk batch CSV by mturk/mtbatch.py.

  * Pay ~30USD for three independent judgements for each question in curated.

  * Download results.  N.B. if you cat multiple files, remove headers, and the
    last line is not EOL-terminated.

  * Inspect them visually using mturk/mtshow.py.

  * Generate a new TSV file using mturk/mt2tsv.py.  Enable debug prints to
    tweak the gold standard update rules.
